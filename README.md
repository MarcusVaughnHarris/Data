# SMILES Datasets
This folder contains three datasets (BioMassPrecursors.csv,Electrophilic_reactants.csv, and Nucleophilic_Reactants.csv).

## ModelData
This folder contains datasets used for fitting and training ML models.

## LabReactants
#### BioMassPrecursors.csv:
This dataset contains molecules easily extracted and isolated from most types of biomass. The few molecules presented in it were chosen specifically as precursor-canidates for surfactant synthesis.
#### Electrophilic_reactants.csv:
This set provides readily available/synthesizable epoxides and cyclic carbonate electrophiles that can be opened up by nucleophilic groups on the biomass precursors. One epoxide and one cyclic carbonate have hydroxyl functionality, allowing them to be added to the precursors via transesterification before being attacked.
#### Nucleophilic_Reactants
This dataset contains nucleophilic alcohol and amine reactants meant to attack various electrophilic groups on the BioMassPrecursors and Electrophilic_reactants.
